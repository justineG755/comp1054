            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p><strong>[Intro: Bruno Mars]</strong><br>
                Say, baby, say, baby, say, baby</p>

            <p><strong>[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars]</strong><br>
                What you doin'? <em>(What you doin'?)</em><br>
                Where you at? <em>(Where you at?)</em><br>
                Oh, you got plans? <em>(You got plans)</em><br>
                Don't say that <em>(Shut your trap)</em><br>
                I'm sippin' wine <em>(Sip, sip)</em> in a robe <em>(Drip, drip)</em><br>
                I look too good <em>(Look too good)</em><br>
                To be alone <em>(Woo, woo)</em><br>
                My house clean <em>(House clean)</em>, my pool warm <em>(Pool warm)</em><br>
                Just shaved, smooth like a newborn<br>
                We should be dancin', romancin'<br>
                In the east wing and the west wing<br>
                Of this mansion, what's happenin'?</p>

            <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]</strong><br>
                I ain't playin' no games<br>
                Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart<br>
                So if you tryna lay in these arms</p>

            <p><strong>[Chorus: Bruno Mars]</strong><br>
                I'ma leave the door open<br>
                <em>(I'ma leave the door open)</em><br>
                I'ma leave the door open, girl<br>
                <em>(I'ma leave the door open)</em><br>
                <em>(Hopin')</em> that you feel the way I feel<br>
                And you want me like I want you tonight, baby<br>
                <em>(Tell me that you're comin' through)</em>
            </p>

            <p><strong>[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars]</strong><br>
                Ooh, you're so sweet <em>(So sweet)</em>, so tight <em>(So tight)</em><br>
                I won't bite <em>(Uh-uh)</em>, unless you like <em>(Unless you like)</em><br>
                If you smoke <em>(What you smoke?)</em>, I got the haze <em>(Purple haze)</em><br>
                And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets <em>(Woo)</em><br>
                Ooh, baby, don't keep me waitin'<br>
                There's so much love we could be makin' <em>(Shamone!)</em><br>
                I'm talkin' kissin', cuddlin'<br>
                Rose petals in the bathtub<br>
                Girl, let's jump in! It's bubblin'</p>

            <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]</strong><br>
                I ain't playin' no games<br>
                Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart<br>
                So if you tryna lay in these arms <em>(If you tryna lay in these arms)</em></p>

            <p><strong>[Chorus: Bruno Mars]</strong><br>
                I'ma leave the door open<br>
                <em>(I'ma leave the door open)</em><br>
                I'ma leave the door open, girl<br>
                <em>(I'ma leave the door open)</em><br>
                <em>(Hopin')</em> that you feel the way I feel<br>
                And you want me like I want you tonight, baby<br>
                Tell me that you're comin' through <em>(Come on, girl)</em>

                Girl, I'm tryna give you this, ah</p>

                Hey, hey, I'ma leave my door open, baby<br>

            <h3>About Leave The Door Open</h3>
            <p>'Leave the Door Open' is a 2021 Grammy-winning debut single. It blends modern R&B with a strong retro
                influence inspired by classic soul music from the 1970s. The song’s lyrics revolve around romance and
                openness, highlighting emotional honesty and intention rather than fast-paced or dramatic love. The
                chill rhythm, layered vocals, and live-sounding instruments give the track a warm and nostalgic feel.
                What makes the song especially effective is how it feels both playful and sincere at the same time,
                creating a mood that is calm and inviting. This balance is a key reason why the song resonates with
                listeners and fits well within the overall aesthetic of the album. It stood out when it was first
                released because it felt different from most popular songs at the time</p>

            <h3>About the Artists</h3>
            <p>'Silk Sonic' is a duo made up of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, who came together to create music
                inspired by classic soul and funk from earlier decades. Both artists are known for their strong musical
                identities, and their collaboration allows them to combine smooth vocals, playful lyricism, and
                live-sounding instrumentation. Rather than focusing on modern production trends, Silk Sonic emphasizes
                groove, performance, and atmosphere. This approach gives their music a nostalgic feel while still
                appealing to modern audiences, making their music feel both timeless and fresh.</p>
